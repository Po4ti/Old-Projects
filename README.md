Source code of fangames i was involved in from ~2018. Featuring lots of jank code.  
  
  
  
**Dancer** - My first fangame, long endurance inspired by "Last TIS" featuring music from "Crypt of The NecroDancer". Phases 1 and 3 made by me, phase 2 made by Arche. 
  
**Bottomless Abyss** - Tribute to leehe work. Inspired by Reanimate from "Touch the Makers". Several attacks made by Arche.  
  
**Defeat The Four Horsemen of Hardcore Gaming** - boss based fangame featuring lots of russian jokes. First 4 bosses made by Anon70000 with a few edits by me.
